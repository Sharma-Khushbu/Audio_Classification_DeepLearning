# Audio_Classification_DeepLearning
Audio classification is the task of assigning a label to an audio clip based on the content of the audio. There are many different approaches to solving this problem, but one popular approach is to use deep learning.

Using the **Python libraries Keras and TensorFlow**, you can build and train a deep learning model for audio classification. **Keras** is a *high-level library* that makes it easy to build and train deep learning models, while **TensorFlow** is a *low-level library* that provides more control over the details of the model's implementation.

To build an audio classification model with **Keras** and **TensorFlow**, you will need to first prepare your audio data. This may involve preprocessing the audio to extract features, such as the power spectrum or **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**. Once you have extracted these features, you can use them as input to a deep learning model.

To build the model, you will need to decide on the architecture of the model. This may involve choosing the number and size of the layers in the model, as well as the activation functions to use. You will also need to choose an optimizer and a loss function to use during training.

Once you have built and compiled the model, you can begin training it on your audio data. This will involve feeding the model batches of audio examples and their corresponding labels, and using the optimizer and loss function to update the model's weights and biases in order to improve its performance on the training data.

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on a test set of audio examples to see how well it generalizes to unseen data. If the model performs well, you can then use it to make predictions on new audio examples.
